        Now, here we are together
        This would've been worth waiting forever
        I always knew it'd feel this way

        And, please, forgive my shaking
        Can't you tell my heart is breaking?
        Can't make myself say what I planned to say

        Baby
        Please, let me wonder
        (If I've been the one you love)
        Please, let me wonder
        (If I'm who you're dreaming of)
        Please let me wonder, love

        I built all my goals around you
        That some day my love would surround you
        You'll never know what we've been through

        For so long I thought about it
        And now I just can't live without it
        This beautiful image I have of you

        Baby
        Please, let me wonder
        (If I've been the one you love)
        Please, let me wonder
        (If I'm who you're dreaming of)
        Please, let me wonder, love

        Please, let me wonder
        (If I've been the one you love)
        Please, let me wonder
        (If I'm who you're dreaming of)
        Please, let me wonder, love

        I love you
